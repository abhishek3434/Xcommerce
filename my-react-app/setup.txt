-------Please follow below architecture-------------

Using the example below, a React project has a source (src) folder where all the essential files and folders are listed: 

└── /src 

  ├── /assets 

  ├── /components 

  ├── /views 

  ├── /services 

  ├── /utils 

  ├── /hooks 

  ├── /store 

  └── App.js 

  ├── index.js 

  ├── index.css 

- The assets folder contains all of the project's static files, such as your logo, fonts, images, and favicons. 
- Components folder contains a bit collection of UI codes such as buttons, forms, avatars, and so on. 
- The views folder contains all your React application's web pages. 
- Services folder contains code that allows you to interact with external API resources. 
- The utils folder contains reusable function snippets for performing quick tasks like text truncation or down casing. 
- Hooks folder contains codes and logic that can be reused across multiple components. 
- The store folder houses your state management files, such as Redux, which are used to make certain functions and variables available throughout your application. 
- The main component of your React application is the App.js file. This file connects all components and views. 
Index.js file is the React application's entry point. It is responsible for bootstrapping the React library and mounting it on the root element. 
index.css is the main and global CSS file for our application. Any writing style to this file will apply throughout the project.
